# a2-foundational-skills
This rubric is intended to help guide expectations and increase transparency. However, it **is not** necessarily fully exhaustive. Make sure to read the detailed explanation on Canvas, and follow the best practices described in the course book and in class.

For full credit, make sure you match variable names **exactly**. Partial credit will be given where appropriate.

- Write a function `remove_digits` that will remove all digits (i.e., 0 through 9) from all elements in a *vector of strings*. (**5 points**)
  - -1 if the logic is unnecessarily complex (e.g., longer than, say, 4 lines of code)
  - -1 if it doesn't remove all digits
  - -1 if it removes characters that aren't digits

- Demonstrate that your approach is successful by passing a vector of courses to your function. (**2 points**)

<br>

## Vectors (**24 points**)

- Create a vector `movies` that contains the names of six movies you like (**2 points**)

- Create a vector `top_three` that only contains the first three movies in the vector (**2 points**)
  - -1 if it doesn't use subsetting

- Using your vector and the paste method, create a vector `excited` that adds the phrase " is a great movie!" to the end of each element in your movies vector (**2 points**)

- Create a vector `without_four` that has your first three movies, and your 5th and 6th movies. You should do this using a _negative index_ (**2 points**)
  - -1 if it doesn't use a negative index

- Create a vector `multiples_of_4` that is every number divisible by 4 between 4 and 400 (**2 points**)

- Create a vector `multiples_of_8` by filtering your `multiples_of_4` variable down to only elements that are divisible by 8 (**2 points**)

<br>

## Lists (**9 points**)

- Create a list called `summary_info` in which you'll store summary information about the `numbers` vector above (**3 points**):
  - 1 point each for mean, median, length

- Now, write a function called `summarize_vector` that takes in a vector of numbers, and returns a list of summary information about that vector (including the mean, median, and length). (**4 points**)
  - 1 point for each for mean, median, length
  - 1 point for the function working properly

- Create a vector `summary_1_to_100` by passing a vector of the values one through one hundred to your `summarize_vector` function (**2 points**)

<br>

## Data Frames (**22 points**, 2 points each)

- Create a vector `students` holding 1,000 values representing students
    - 1 if incorrect spacing (e.g., no space between "Student" and the number)

- Create a vector `math_grades` that holds 1000 random values in it
    - -1 if mean or standard deviation isn't properly set
    - -1 if values aren't normally distributed

- Replace any values in the `math_grades` vector that are above 100 with the number 100

- Create a vector `spanish_grades` that holds 1000 random values in it
    - -1 if mean or standard deviation isn't properly set
    - -1 if values aren't normally distributed

- Replace any values in the `spanish_grades` that are above 100 with the number 100

- Create a data.frame variable `grades` by combining your vectors `students`, `math_grades`, and `spanish_grades`. Make sure to properly handle strings
    - -1 if data frame is created with any factor values

- Create a variable `num_students` that contains the number of rows in your data.frame `grades`

- Create a variable `num_courses` that contains the number of columns in your data.frame `grades` minus one (b/c of their names)
    - -1 if incorrect calculation
    - -1 if the number of columns isn't calculated using an appropriate R function

- Add a new column `grade_diff` to your dataframe, which is equal to the difference between the math and spanish grade columns

- Add another column `better_at_math` as a boolean (TRUE/FALSE) variable that indicates that a student got a better grade in math

- Create a variable `num_better_at_math` that is the number (i.e., one numeric value) of students better at math
    - -1 if the result isn't a single value
